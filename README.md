## Getting started

If you're already have the API running locally, a simple `npm install && npm start`
should be enough. Otherwise follow the procedure below:

- Install (if you don't have them):

  - The API project: https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-api
  - NodeJS, ideally using [asdf-vm](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) with `NODEJS_CHECK_SIGNATURES=no asdf install`
  - App dependencies: `npm install`

- Run:
  - `npm start` - Start the front-end
  - `npm run test` - Runs all unit tests

Front-end is started on http://localhost:3333

A default account should have been created for you with
e-mail=`admin@captainfact.io` and password=`password`.

## Conventions

#### File structure

```
app
├── API => API libraries for both REST API and websockets
├── assets => Assets imported from JS
├── components => All react components
├── i18n => Translations
├── lib => Misc utilities
├── state => All redux related
│   ├── comments
│   │   ├── effects.js => Async actions creators, always return a promise
│   │   ├── record.js => The object representing a single comment
│   │   ├── reducer.js => Reducer + actions creators, always return an action object
│   │   └── selectors.js => Re-select selectors to select data in state
│   └── ...
├── static => Static assets, directly copied to the public directory
├── styles => Stylesheets in .sass format, all included from application.sass
└── router.jsx => Application router and main entry point
```

#### Styling

Styling is based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) and was initially
customized with SASS. However we now include [styled-components](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system) and [@rebass/grid](https://github.com/rebassjs/grid).
This has become the prefered way to build new components.

#### Icons

We bundle a custom font icon built with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/). You can find scripts and config
for this in `dev/` but the preferred (and easiest) way to add new icons today
is to use `https://styled-icons.js.org/`.
