## Getting started

The REST API has not been open-sourced yet so you must have been invited to
the gitlab registry for `./dev/start_api.sh` to run correctly.

* Install (if you don't have them):
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (to start the API easily)
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
  * App dependencies: `npm install`
    
* Run:
  * `./dev/start_api.sh` - Start the API (with an Elixir console attached)
  * `npm start` - Start the frontend
  * `npm run test` - run all unit tests

A default account should have been created for you with
email=`admin@captainfact.io` and password=`password`.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
