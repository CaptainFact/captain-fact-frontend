## Getting started

This is a HTML5 application, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.

## Main Libraries / Frameworks

- ES6 with Babel
- ReactJS: vue layer
- Redux: state management
- ReactRouter: routing
- phoenix: interaction with phoenix socket
- Bulma: base styles (we're still using an old 0.3.2 version, documentation
[here (Github)](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/tree/0395dc59d8b147f2f47d057a6ffde2eb2966db49/docs/documentation))

### Effects

An effect is an async action that may dispatch one or more actions when called. It always returns a
promise, ideally without the need for .catch(...) - errors should be converted to FSA errors objects.
