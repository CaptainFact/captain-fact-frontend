CaptainFact has grown on upon the soil of many great open source projects such as:

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
* [Phoenix Framework](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Bulma](http://bulma.io/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [adorable.io](http://avatars.adorable.io/) for their great consistent avatar service (the funny faces 
  you see if you don't set your own profile picture)
* The Wikimedia foundation for all the speakers pictures and other metadata. You can find more 
  info about this part on [our data repository](https://github.com/CaptainFact/captain-fact-data).
