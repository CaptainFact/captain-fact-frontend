## Comments

CaptainFact is no ordinary social platform. Its vocation is to
focus on facts, evidence, sources, arguments and context
but not to opinions.
The comment section can be used to open the context but must not
deviate from the initial subject. Off-topic is sanctioned by the community.

The `Approve` and `Refute` buttons should only be used when evidence
allow for **significantly** tilting the verification to one side or the other.
A minor error on a date or a slightly coarse rounding on a number do not
necessarily deserve to be invalidated: one can **confirm**
the statement as soon as the order of magnitude is good or post in commentary
if faced with an acceptable approximation.

## Statements

To have its place on CaptainFact, a quote **must** fill **out at least one** of
the following criteria:

* Be verifiable
* Mention a source or a content on which a comment could make the link
* Present incomplete or approximate elements
* Making a false, misleading or deceptive argument

It is also recommended to ask the following questions before adding
a quotation:

* Could a typical person, upon hearing the statement, ask himself
  if it's true? For example, the statement "The sky is blue" is verifiable
  but doesn't really need to be sourced.
* Is the statement likely to be repeated and shared?
* Is this a minor error or an acceptable hyperbole - often used in politics?

#### About opinions in statements

Opinions should as far as possible avoid appearing in quotations.
You can, if it does not deprive it of its meaning, replace the judgments of
value (best, worst, stupid...etc) by `[...]`.

For example :

> This social measure was the worst. It disgusts me. It has created an increase in unemployment, which is madness.

Can become:

> This social measure \[...] has created an increase in unemployment
