## Personal data

We will **never** sell your personal data and we don't have much to sell
anyways, we only collect what we need to run the site :

##### If you create an account

  * Email
  * Password (encrypted with [bcrypt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) + salted)

##### If you don't have an account

  * Your IP address **only** when requesting a password reset

## Public data : social interactions

You should consider all your interactions (commenting, adding a source...) as **public**.
You're free to use your real name or just a good'old username.

Though nothing is infallible, we care about security and we try to follow the best practices to
ensure your data stay as safe as possible.
