None of us is expert in legal questions but we would like to have policies that guarantee our users privacy and control

We’re also in favor of a [strong free-speech policy](https://captainfact.io/help/censorship_requests).

Law geek’s passionate about these questions could help us achieving our goals without conflicting with international
