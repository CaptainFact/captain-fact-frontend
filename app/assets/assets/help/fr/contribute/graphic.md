CaptainFact is looking for graphic designers who feel inspired by this project. Check below to see how you can
contribute !

## Achievements

CaptainFact has a strong gamification aspect. We want to make it pleasant to contribute and reward users bringing
positive content. One of the ways to achieve that is achievements, like the ones you see in video games. We need them to 
be creative and fun, so the main rule here is to take pleasure in what you do ;)

For details about which achievements are currently open to submissions, technical constraints and license stuff checkout 
[this Github issue](https://github.com/CaptainFact/captain-fact-frontend/issues/6).

## UI / UX

Though we have graphic designers working from time to time on small aspects of the project (logo...etc) we currently 
don't have a "main" graphic designer. Your experience, advices and contributions on the website & extension UI / UX would be extremely valuable.

## Ideas

We're a collaborative project. You have an idea about something incredible we should implement, or how to implement it ?
