# About my privacy

## Website

 We will **never** sell your personal data (email, name...etc).
 However, you should consider all your interactions (voting, commenting, flagging...) as public.
 
 Also, we don't use any external tracker nor do we implement any social network buttons.
 The only external code we run here is the one for the video player.

## Extension

 You can select whether or not you want to activate videos overlay in one click, using the extension
 popup.
 
 <!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->
 
 If you do activate it, the extension will send a request to CaptainFact from time to time to sync available videos.
 
 **We do not log nor record the videos you're watching.**
