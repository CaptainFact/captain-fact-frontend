We will **never** sell your personal data and we don't have much to sell anyways: we don't
collect stuff that we don't need to run the site.

However, you should consider all your interactions (voting, commenting, flagging...) as **public**.
You're free to use your real name or just a simple good'old username.

Though nothing is infallible, we care about security and we try to follow the best practices to
ensure your data stay as safe as possible.
