> _With great power comes great responsibility_

Content creation actions (adding speakers, statements, sources...etc) usually have very few
restrictions. If you don't use this right responsibly, other users flags and down votes
will end up limiting your actions.
 
Judgement actions such as voting and flagging are limited to avoid abusing them and to
**reinforce their meaning**.

# New user restrictions

Until you reach a [reputation](/help/reputation) of `125`, you will be considered as a new user.
Your limitations for all actions will be way below the normal.


# Negative reputation

[Reputation](/help/reputation) can be negative if you get too much flags and down votes
without positive ones to compensate.

When your reputation passes bellow `-5`, you won't be able to do anything beside posting very few comments
each day - this gives you a chance to come back in the game with positive contributions.

However if your reputation goes below `-30` you won't be able to do any action anymore.


## I've been given a negative reputation unfairly !

If you think your situation is not fair, please [contact us](/help/contact)
and we'll investigate.
