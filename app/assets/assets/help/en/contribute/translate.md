Helping to translate CaptainFact doesn't require any technical skills, it's just a matter
of replacing strings in files.

#### If you're comfortable with git

1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/CaptainFact/captain-fact-frontend)
2. Edit or create files in `app/assets/assets/locales/${YOUR_LOCALE}/${namespace}.json`
   to translate the user interface
3. Edit or create files in `app/assets/assets/help/${YOUR_LOCALE}/${page}.md` to translate help pages
    like this one
4. Make a pull request against `staging` branch

#### If you don't know what the heck git is about

[Contact us](/help/contact) and we'll send you the files along with instructions.
